    <p>"Hiya pal! I'm lookin' for a buddy to jailbreak me. A buddy that I could spend my evenings cuddling with... you know the type. <br><br>

      My name is Tyler and I'm a 6-7 year old Mixed Breed. Staff at the shelter aren't too sure what kinda mix I am, but they think that I must have some Terrier in me, so that's what I'm goin' with. I originally came to the shelter as a stray that
      went unclaimed, so now I'm looking for a home to call my own. Hopefully a family comes attached with that. I'm a real sweet boy and love getting pets, but on my terms. Don't get me wrong, I love people and getting pets, but I do like to decide
      when and how. I can also be just a little shy at first and I startle easily. Try not to sneak up on me, you know. I do get along with other dogs and cats. I also appear to be house-trained. I would do best in a home without any youngins,
      please.
      Older kids are okay. <br><br>

      My adoption fee is $35 to an approved adopter. If you would like more information on me, please give SVASC a call at (540) 943-5142 or stop by the shelter during open hours. SVASC is located at 1001 Mt. Torrey Rd. Lyndhurst, VA."</p>
